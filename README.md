# Software-Rasterizer
I created a fully functioning software rasterizer, and a scene where you can move around and look at a maze. You can also toggle between Software Rasterization and OPENGL
WASD to move, left mouse click and drag to look around
Q to quit
Spacebar to switch between My Software Rasterizer and OPENGL
The maze layout and textures can be found in Resources/maze3.txt, along with the texture images
